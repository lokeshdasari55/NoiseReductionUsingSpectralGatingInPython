Future telecommunication will more and more rely on proper noise reduction techniques with less convolution.
Speech communication, speech augmentation, and speech transmission have quite a great challenge regarding noise in audio transmissions.
Fast Fourier Transmission (FTT) and spectral gating techniques are a handful of algorithms that have been often used during the reduction of noise.
These algorithms have indeed been put into effect to suppress any noise, especially noise from fans in the room, horn sounds, and dog barks on the streets.

Noise Reduction procedure:
• Spectral gating is an uncommon filter effect that is used as tool for creating sound design.
• It divides incoming signal into two frequency ranges one above and another below a
center frequency and bandwidth parameters.
• The algorithm uses a noise gate to set threshold gates. The signal which crosses above the lower gate will be recorded and so the lower gate is called as open gate,
• If it crosses specified upper threshold gate signal stops recording. So, the upper gate is called as closed gate.
• These gates are helpful to take signal between the two gates and the signal below and above gates taken as noise. So only required Noise-reduced audio will be produced as output.
• The Fast Fourier transform is a computationally faster way to calculate the DFT –discrete Fourier transform and has good time complexity.
• Fast Fourier Transform is the foremost tool and is rapidly used in signal processing.

Advantages of Introduced System:
• It deals with any type of noise, so it is easy to reduce any type of noise with a single algorithm.
• This algorithm is used to deal with human speech as it can deal with non-stationary as well as stationary signals.
• Reduce the noise in the algorithm to almost zero extents.
• The model effectively reduces the background noise caused by many factors to hear the context of the audio more clearly.
